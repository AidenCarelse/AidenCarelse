# Hello there, I'm Aiden! 👋
### 👨‍💻 Programmer, App Developer, Student and Gamer

Hey, I'm Aiden Carelse, a Software Developer who has a passion for programming, solving puzzles and of course playing video games. I'm currently working as an App Developer at Real Bean Entertainment, while studying Computing Sciences at Simon Fraser University. I first got into coding with command blocks from *Minecraft* (😂), then improved upon my skills with classes in high school, and since then made it my career and field of study. My Github consists mostly of personal projects that I build in my free time outside of work or school, as well as ones created for events, such as Hackathons. I hope you can find something that interests you! 😊

### 💻 What I'm currently working on (outside of school and work)...
- [WIP] Star Wars Character Guessing Game: Available on my github, the game is based off of Wordle an its many spinoffs and involves guessing a *Star Wars* character from an increasingly large databank of information!
- Teaching myself about SQL and databases.

### 📚 Languages
- *Proficient:* Java, C#
- *Advanced:* Javascript, C++, C, XML
- *Intermediate:* Python, HTML, CSS

Je peux aussi parler en Français!

### 🎮 Other Interests
- Gaming
- Sports
- LEGO
