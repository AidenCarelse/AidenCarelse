# Hello there, I'm Aiden! 👋
### 👨‍💻 Software Developer, Student and Gamer

Hey, I'm Aiden Carelse, a Software Developer who has a passion for programming, solving puzzles and of course playing video games. I'm currently working as a Software QA Engineer at Incognito Software Systems, while studying Computing Sciences at Simon Fraser University. I first got into coding with command blocks from *Minecraft* (😂), then improved upon my skills with classes in high school, and since then made it my career and field of study. My Github consists mostly of personal projects that I build in my free time outside of work or school, as well as ones created for events, such as Hackathons. I hope you can find something that interests you! 😊

### 💻 What I'm currently working on (outside of work and school)...
- [WIP] [PokeGuess]([https://github.com/AidenCarelse/pokeguess]): Available on my github, my friend and I have been creating a game that is based off of Wordle and its many spinoffs and involves guessing a *Pokemon* using clues from previous guesses!

### 📚 Languages
- Proficient: *Java, C#*
- Advanced: *Javascript, C++, CSS, HTML, C, XML*
- Intermediate: *Python, Haskell*
- Je peux aussi parler en Français!

### 🎮 Other Interests
- Gaming (I enjoy video, board and card games!)
- Sports (Go Jays!)
- LEGO (Espcially *Star Wars*)
